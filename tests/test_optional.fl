# Test semicolon optionality

# Case 1: No semicolon
let a = 1
print(a)

# Case 2: With semicolon
let b = 2;
print(b);

# Case 3: Mixed
let c = 3
let d = 4;
print(c); print(d)

# Case 4: No newline (optional check, might fail if parser strict on separators but user just asked about semicolons)
# let e = 5 let f = 6 
# print(e) print(f)
