# Tensor Operations Example

# Creation
let t1 = ones([2, 3])
let t2 = rand([2, 3])

print("Tensor t1 (ones):")
print(t1)

# Arithmetic
let t3 = t1 + t2
print("t1 + t2:")
print(t3)

# Scalar math
let t4 = t1 * 10.0
print("t1 * 10.0:")
print(t4)

# Matrix Multiplication
let a = ones([2, 2])
let b = ones([2, 2])
let c = a @ b
print("Matrix Multiply result:")
print(c)

# Reductions
print("Sum of t3:", sum(t3))
print("Mean of t3:", mean(t3))
